# Mouse Mover & Mob Finder - Streamlined Version

## Project Overview
A streamlined Python automation application for gaming, specifically designed for automated mouse movement, text detection, and mob targeting. This is the production-ready version with only the essential files.

## Project Structure

### Main Application
#### Mob Finder Direct (`mob_finder_direct.py`) - **PRODUCTION READY** ✅
- **Purpose**: High-speed direct mob targeting with advanced protection features
- **Features**: 
  - Interactive character and pet name setup at startup
  - Direct text reading in game area with OCR filtering
  - Pre-defined red area margins for performance
  - Automatic clicking without permission
  - Character protection (100-pixel radius + name-based protection)
  - Text-to-mob offset for accurate targeting
  - Auto-start continuous monitoring
  - Continuous keyboard pressing (123145 sequence)
  - Background threading for keyboard automation
  - Text filtering to exclude IDE/code text
  - Game window focus management
  - Multiple stop options (Ctrl+C, 'stop', 'quit', 'exit', 'q')
  - **VERIFIED**: Character and pet name protection system
- **Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All features working and tested

### Configuration Files
#### 1. Mob Names (`mobs.txt`)
- **Purpose**: Contains list of mob names to detect
- **Content**: "Mangyang, Black Tiger, Baroi Wolf, Earth Ghost, Hyungno Ghost Soldier, Hyungno Ghost, Ultra, Ultra Blood Devil, Spider"
- **Status**: ✅ Working

#### 2. Protected Names (`protected_names.txt`)
- **Purpose**: Configuration file for character and pet names to avoid clicking
- **Format**: One name per line, comments start with #
- **Note**: Interactive setup at startup overrides this file
- **Status**: ✅ Working

#### 3. Requirements (`requirements.txt`)
- **Purpose**: Python dependencies
- **Dependencies**: pyautogui, opencv-python, numpy, easyocr, Pillow, mss
- **Status**: ✅ Working

#### 4. Documentation
- **README.md**: User instructions and setup guide
- **ProjectMemory.md**: This file - project documentation

## Current Status - **PRODUCTION READY** ✅

### All Issues Resolved ✅
- **Primary Issue**: Name protection now working correctly
- **Root Cause Fixed**: Protection logic added to targeting phase
- **Status**: All protected names are properly excluded from targeting

### Key Features Working
- [x] Interactive character/pet name setup at startup
- [x] Automatic OCR text detection and filtering
- [x] Character protection (distance + name-based)
- [x] Pet protection with fuzzy matching
- [x] Continuous keyboard automation (123145)
- [x] Automatic mouse movement and clicking
- [x] Multiple stop options
- [x] Game window focus management
- [x] Real-time console feedback

## Technical Architecture

### Mob Finder Direct Workflow ✅
1. **Startup**: Interactive character and pet name collection
2. **Initialization**: Load OCR, set margins, initialize keyboard automation
3. **Auto-Start**: Begin continuous monitoring mode
4. **Parallel Processing**: 
   - Main thread: Screenshot capture, text detection, mob targeting
   - Background thread: Continuous keyboard pressing (123145)
5. **Smart Protection**: 
   - 100-pixel radius protection around screen center
   - Name-based protection for character and pets (exact, partial, fuzzy matching)
   - Text filtering to exclude IDE/code text
6. **Intelligent Targeting**: 
   - Detect text position
   - Apply protection filters
   - Apply 50-pixel downward offset to target mob body
   - Move mouse and click automatically
7. **Continuous Operation**: Repeat indefinitely until stopped

### Protection Features ✅
- **Distance Protection**: 100-pixel safety radius around character
- **Name Protection**: Character and pet names avoided with multiple matching methods:
  - Exact matches: `MyCharacter` = `MyCharacter`
  - Case insensitive: `mycharacter` = `MyCharacter`
  - Partial matches: `MyChar` matches `MyCharacter`
  - Fuzzy matching: Handles OCR errors with 80% similarity threshold
- **Text Filtering**: Excludes IDE/code text for better performance
- **Game Focus**: Ensures game window is focused before operations

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Run Application**: `python mob_finder_direct.py`
3. **Setup Protection**: Enter your character name and pet names when prompted
4. **Focus Game Window**: During 3-second countdown, make sure game is active
5. **Automatic Operation**: App will automatically target mobs while avoiding your character/pets

### Stop Options
- Press `Ctrl+C` for immediate stop
- Type `stop`, `quit`, `exit`, or `q` and press Enter

### Safety Features
- **Character Protection**: 100-pixel radius + name-based protection
- **Pet Protection**: All entered pet names are protected with fuzzy matching
- **Emergency Stop**: Multiple stop options for immediate shutdown
- **Game Focus Management**: Ensures proper game window interaction

## System Requirements
- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (primary), Linux/macOS (compatible)
- **Python**: 3.7+ (3.8+ recommended)
- **RAM**: 4GB+ (8GB+ recommended)
- **Display**: 1920×1080 resolution (optimal)

## Project History - Cleaned Up
- **Previous Version**: Had multiple applications and test files
- **Current Version**: Streamlined to single production-ready application
- **Removed Files**: Alternative versions, test scripts, and development files
- **Status**: Production-ready with verified protection features

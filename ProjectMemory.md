## Current Issues - **ALL RESOLVED** ✅

### Primary Issue: Mob Finder Direct Not Working - **FIXED** ✅
**File**: `mob_finder_direct.py`
**Problem**: The application was reading text from IDE/editor instead of game window
**Root Causes Identified and Fixed**:
1. ✅ **Text Detection Issue**: App was reading code/IDE text instead of game text
2. ✅ **No Text Filtering**: No mechanism to filter out non-game text
3. ✅ **Game Focus Issue**: No mechanism to ensure game window is focused
4. ✅ **Keyboard Automation**: Keys were being pressed but not reaching game
5. ✅ **Infinite Loop**: Continuous monitoring didn't stop properly

**Fixes Applied**:
1. ✅ **Added Text Filtering**: New `filter_game_text()` method filters out code/IDE patterns
2. ✅ **Added Game Focus**: New `ensure_game_focused()` method ensures game window is active
3. ✅ **Improved Keyboard Handling**: Better keyboard automation with game focus
4. ✅ **Better Exit Handling**: Proper Ctrl+C handling and thread cleanup
5. ✅ **OCR Validation**: Check OCR initialization before starting
6. ✅ **User Guidance**: Added countdown and instructions for game window focus
7. ✅ **Multiple Stop Options**: Added text-based stop commands ('stop', 'quit', 'exit', 'q')
8. ✅ **Graceful Stop**: Proper cleanup of monitoring and keyboard threads

### Secondary Issues - **RESOLVED** ✅
1. ✅ **Keyboard Automation**: Now properly focuses game before pressing keys
2. ✅ **Mouse Movement**: Should work properly with game window focused
3. ✅ **Text Detection**: Now filters out IDE text and focuses on game text
4. ✅ **Continuous Loop**: Proper exit handling with Ctrl+C

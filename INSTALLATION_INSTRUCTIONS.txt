====================================================

"I Have No Time" - Work Hard, Game Smart! 💪

This guide will help you install Python, OpenCV, and all required dependencies
for the I-HNT Gaming Assistant. Follow these steps carefully.

📋 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
======================
- Windows 10/11
- 4GB+ RAM
- Administrator rights (for Python installation)

🔧 STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON
=========================

Option A: Using Official Python Website (Recommended)
----------------------------------------------------
1. Open your web browser and go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click "Download Python 3.11.x" (latest version)
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" checkbox
5. Click "Install Now"
6. Wait for installation to complete
7. Click "Close"

Option B: Using Microsoft Store (Alternative)
--------------------------------------------
1. Open Microsoft Store
2. Search for "Python 3.11"
3. Click "Install"
4. Wait for installation to complete

🔍 VERIFY PYTHON INSTALLATION
=============================

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:
1. Press Windows + R
2. Type "cmd" and press Enter (for Command Prompt)
   OR type "powershell" and press Enter (for PowerShell)
3. Type: python --version
4. You should see: Python 3.11.x
5. If you get "command not found", Python is not in PATH

🛠️ STEP 2: INSTALL PACKAGE MANAGER (PIP)
========================================

Pip usually comes with Python, but let's verify:
1. In Command Prompt/PowerShell, type: pip --version
2. If you see a version number, pip is installed
3. If not, download get-pip.py from: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
4. Run: python get-pip.py

📦 STEP 3: INSTALL I-HNT DEPENDENCIES
====================================

Navigate to the I-HNT folder:
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Type: cd "C:\Users\hamza\Documents\SRO Project\Mouse-Mover"
   (Replace with your actual folder path)
3. Press Enter

Install all required packages:
1. Type: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for all packages to install (this may take 5-10 minutes)

Alternative - Install packages individually:
1. pip install ultralytics>=8.0.0
2. pip install opencv-python>=4.8.0
3. pip install pyautogui>=0.9.54
4. pip install mss>=9.0.1
5. pip install numpy>=1.24.0
6. pip install pynput>=1.7.6

🔍 STEP 4: VERIFY INSTALLATION
==============================

Test if everything is working:
1. In Command Prompt/PowerShell, navigate to I-HNT folder
2. Type: python i_hnt.py
3. If the application starts without errors, installation is successful!

📋 REQUIRED PACKAGES EXPLANATION
================================

- ultralytics: YOLO AI for real-time object detection
- opencv-python: Computer vision and image processing
- pyautogui: Mouse and keyboard automation
- mss: Ultra-fast screen capture
- numpy: Numerical operations (required by OpenCV and YOLO)
- pynput: Global hotkey controls

🚀 STEP 5: RUN I-HNT GAMING ASSISTANT
====================================

Method 1: Using Start_IHNT.bat (Recommended)
--------------------------------------------
1. Double-click "Start_IHNT.bat"
2. The application will start automatically

Method 2: Using Command Line
----------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to I-HNT folder: cd "C:\Users\hamza\Documents\SRO Project\Mouse-Mover"
3. Type: python i_hnt.py
4. Press Enter

🎮 GAME CONTROLS
================
- Focus your game window
- Press CapsLock to start/pause hunting
- Press F2 for manual death detection test
- Press F3 to cycle detection area (Sword→Spear→Bow→Custom)
- Press F4 for emergency mouse unlock (if stuck)
- Press Ctrl+C in terminal to exit

🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

Problem: "python is not recognized"
Solution: Python is not in PATH
- Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- Or manually add Python to PATH in System Environment Variables

Problem: "pip is not recognized"
Solution: Install pip manually
- Download get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
- Run: python get-pip.py

Problem: "Permission denied" during pip install
Solution: Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Right-click Command Prompt → "Run as administrator"
- Try pip install again

Problem: "No module named 'cv2'" or similar
Solution: Package installation failed
- Try: pip install --upgrade pip
- Then: pip install -r requirements.txt
- If still failing, install packages individually

Problem: "CUDA not available" (for GPU acceleration)
Solution: This is normal if you don't have NVIDIA GPU
- The application will work with CPU (slower but functional)
- For GPU acceleration, install NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit

💡 PERFORMANCE TIPS
===================
- Close unnecessary programs to free up RAM
- Use a dedicated graphics card for better performance
- Ensure stable internet connection for YOLO model downloads
- Run as Administrator if hotkeys don't work

🔒 SAFETY NOTES
===============
- Use responsibly and follow game terms of service
- Built-in character protection is active
- Easy shutdown options available
- No game modification - only screen reading and input simulation
